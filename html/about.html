               <p>Hi, I'm <dfn title = "A rather awkward person with a propensity for nihilism">Daniel</dfn>, and we've found ourselves in an existential quandary. Full of loathing and self-doubt; racked with the pain and isolation of our pitiful meaningless existence. Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Information Systems with a focus on Software Development (for now). In my spare time, I sleep and play video games (Primarily CSGO, TF2, and more recently those of a <dfn title = "Virtual Reality">VR</dfn> nature).</p>

                  It is my aspiration that this site becomes a glorious monument to the improvement which I feel I am in desperate need. To this home I will try to bring everything from the web trifecta (obviously), to database and server software, *nix, , and data science with R. Generally what ever I can manage to cram in here and strikes my fancy. Along with the nitty-gritty technical stuff, I will try to improve the site with more abstract practices such as design principles. Additionally, my day-to-day experiences will find their way on here (when I have some).
